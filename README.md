## Implementation Notes
- Built with **WordPress** as the CMS.  
- **Custom Post Types (CPTs)** created to manage and organize Events.  
- A **single page template** was implemented for displaying individual events.  
- **Elementor Builder** was used for styling and layout customization to ensure a modern, responsive design.  
- **Custom fields** integrated (via ACF) to manage event details like posters, dates, and descriptions.  
- The setup allows easy scalability and consistent design for all future events.
